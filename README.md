## Introduction

Dida is a tiny experimental [auxlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language) with strict grammar, simple phonology and easy orthography. Its grammar is largely *a priori*. It contains *a posteriori* vocabulary imported from English according to [rules of mutilation](#rules-of-mutilation) in a mnemonic manner. Thus Dida is intended to be easy to learn rather than being comprehensible at first sight. The name **Dida** comes from **di** (this) plus **da** (that), since such pronouns are extensively used.

## Design Principles

The most notable feature of Dida is that it makes extensive use of pronouns (and other new categories of substitute or placeholder words) which can function in place of more specific vocabulary. This allows reasonably effective communication without a large shared vocabulary, relying instead upon context and other means of indication (such as gestures, drawings, photographs or foreign phrases).

### Sentence Archetypes

- [word].

## Experiments

> **Dida.** = Dida.

## Rules of Mutilation

When importing words from English:

- Words may be shortened for reasons of:
    - expedience or brevity
    - grammar
- For simple isolated vowels:
    - a remains a
    - i remains i
    - o remains o
- For doubled consonants:
    - th /ð/ becomes d

## Lexicon

1. **da** = that
